                <p class="artist">TWICE</p>
                <hr>
                <p class="entry-summary">After two whole months of procrastinating over a class project, I finally got around to finishing! It felt so invigorating to click the Submit button when I did, I almost forgot all about the feelings of dread that clouded my thoughts countless days beforehand. Looking past that, I just felt like this song was the perfect way to celebrate the hard work and dedication that I put into my project. Not to mention, my final product was not too far off from what I originally wanted—so consider me satisfied!</p>

                <hr>
                <p class="entry-summary">With two major holidays coming up, tonight felt like the perfect night to help my mom get the house prepared for all of the holiday festivities! Of course, I had to play my favorite Christmas album to make putting up decorations that more exciting. Bonding with family over something as simple as decorating the house really makes my heart happy. Everything about the holidays just brings me so much joy and when we combine this with Justin Bieber’s Under the Mistletoe album, it’s hard to believe that some people’s favorite holiday isn’t Christmas!</p>

                <hr>
                <p class="entry-summary">I finally got around to listening to Daniel Caesar’s new album today on the way home from school. As I drove home, the sun had started to go down and I felt like I started to resonate with the song even more. It felt as if a river of questions started to flow out of me and I also started thinking of all the “maybes” and “what-ifs” pertaining to my future. More than ever, I feel the weight of my adulting and I still don’t feel very secure in my plans for myself.</p>

                <h3>Turning Green</h3>
                <p class="artist">Maki</p>
                <hr>
                <p class="entry-summary">Today, I felt like I was the main character of an indie, coming-of-age romance movie. It was the first time I had seen a significant person from my past and I was overcome with feelings of regret and nostalgia. Maki’s song perfectly captures the essence of what I felt tonight. He lists the nagging questions that were somehow always at the back of my mind and were now at its forefront. How have they been since we stopped talking? Did they miss me? Can we go back to being friends?</p>

                <h3>Love Story</h3>
                <p class="artist">Taylor Swift</p>
                <hr>
                <p class="entry-summary">When I was younger, I always fantasized the concept of finding the Romeo to my Juliet. Who would they be? How would I know when I finally found them? During those times, I remember listening to a lot of Taylor Swift’s old songs. She would always capture the essence of teenage love and crushing on someone. Now, as a 22-year-old in college, I feel like I’ve lost that innocent and naïve part of my younger self. But, after listening to some old Taylor Swift songs again, I found myself getting giddy and excited about finding The One.</p>
